<h2>Girls Just Want to Have Fun</h2>
<p>I come home in the morning light<br>
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"<br>
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones<br>
And girls, they wanna have fun<br>
Oh girls just want to have fun</p>
<p>The phone rings in the middle of the night<br>
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"<br>
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one<br>
But girls, they wanna have fun<br>
Oh girls just want to have</p>
<p>That's all they really want<br>
Some fun<br>
When the working day is done<br>
Oh girls, they wanna have fun<br>
Oh girls just wanna have fun (girls, they wanna, wanna have fun, girls wanna have)</p>
<p>Some boys take a beautiful girl<br>
And hide her away from the rest of the world<br>
I want to be the one to walk in the sun<br>
Oh girls, they wanna have fun<br>
Oh girls just wanna have</p>
<p>That's all they really want<br>
Some fun<br>
When the working day is done<br>
Oh girls, they wanna have fun<br>
Oh girls just want to have fun (girls, they wanna, wanna have fun, girls wanna have)<br>
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)<br>
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl (girls just wanna have fun)<br>
Girls just wanna have fun<br>
They just wanna, they just wanna<br>
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)<br>
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl (girls just wanna have fun)<br>
Girls just want to have fun</p>
<p>When the working<br>
When the working day is done<br>
Oh when the working day is done, oh girls<br>
Girls, they wanna have fun, everybody<br></p>
<p>They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)<br>
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girls (girls just wanna have fun)<br>
Girls just want to have fun</p>
<p>when the working<br>
When the working day is done (they just wanna, they just wanna)<br>
Oh when the working day is done, oh girl (girls just wanna have fun)<br>
Girls just wanna have fun (they just wanna, they just wanna)</p>
